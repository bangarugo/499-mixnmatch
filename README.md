* **Ensure you have React 18 or greater** 

2. **Install Python and Dependencies:**

  * python \-m pip install \--upgrade pip

* pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers torch torchvision pillow

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**: 

* Create a .env file in the root of your project (same level as the server folder) with the content from ed.

6. **Navigate to the Server Directory**: 

* Move into the server directory:   
  cd server 

7. **Install Server Dependencies**: 

* Once in the server directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies: npm install i

8. **Start the Server**: 

- You need to start two servers:   
  * First server is for Python  
    * **Start the Python Server**  
    1. Navigate to the server directory and run:

 uvicorn analyze\_fashion:app \--host 127.0.0.1 \--port 8000

* Second server is for the Database  
* **Start the Database Server**  
  1. Run the following command:  
     Npm run dev 

You should see the message:  **Database Connected Successfully and Server started on port 8080 in your terminal if everything is set up correctly.** 

**DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL THAT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING THE SERVER \!\!**

9. **Open a New Terminal Window**: 

* Open a new terminal window (or tab) to start the client.
